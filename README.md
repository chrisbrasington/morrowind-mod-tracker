# MODLIST for [OPENMW](https://openmw.org/) 0.50

## Getting Started

If you're new to modding morrowind, I'd recommend starting with the [I Heart Vanilla](https://modding-openmw.com/lists/i-heart-vanilla/) guide and modlist. It adds bugfixes, quality of life improvements, some higher quality textures/meshes and things like graphic herbalism (seeing the plants you pick).

Beyond that - this is my personal extended list as it has grown over time. Things that I felt enhanced the experience without deviating too far from the core experience, such as volumetric fog, dynamic actors (the game not pausing when you talk to NPCs), and some immersive shaders/lighting. 

[Tamriel Rebuilt](https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/) is the real gold to be found here - but that can be added after playing the main game.
